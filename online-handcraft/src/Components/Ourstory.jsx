                        most intricate craft forms. We started this social enterprise close to 10 years ago in order to preserve, showcase
                         and share the talent of India's artisans with the world. We hope to be able to raise the dignity of the Indian
                          artisan in our own way and kindle an interest and support for an unsurpassed legacy of craft that spans millennia
                         and spreads across the length and breadth of the land. It is our effort to curate an undeniably unique selection 
                         of traditional art and craft translated into a range of beautiful, contemporary products.</p>
